# Cloud Database

{The Cloud Database that I chose was with DynamoDB that is from AWS and implementing it within my code.}

{The structure of the database was a NOSQL database that allows for the ability to create and modify items dynamically and allows for
further implementation with things such as Lambda that can streamline and automate updates within the products in the future with the use of
the NoSQL database structure provided by AWS.}
